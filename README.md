# Project_Scanner_3D

After establishing a state-of-the-art and analysing the different solutions that already exists, we have to decide which technology or combinaison of technology we will use to have an automated **3D Scanner** capable of scanning objects of a chosen size with a frozen max size of our choice.
The scanner will embed a microcontroller to complete the calculation necessary for the treatments. After the scan completion, the ÂµC needs to output a 3D file of a chosen format.
